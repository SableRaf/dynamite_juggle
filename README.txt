TECHNICAL NOTES
- You will need a playstation move controller already paired with your computer.
  Instructions can be found in the PS Move API repository (https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi)
- So far, it has been tested on MacOS 10.7.5 only. Binaries for Windows and Linux are very much alpha.
  If you try them, please let me know how it went in the issues section.
