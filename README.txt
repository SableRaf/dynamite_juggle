HOW TO PLAY
Press the MOVE button to arm the explosive
Press the TRIGGER to ignite the fuse
Pass the dynamite around
If someone passes you the dynamite, you have to take it!
Shake the dynamite to make it burn faster!
Any player touching the stick when it blows up is out of the game
Press START for a brand new stick of TNT
The game goes on until one player (or none) remains.
The winner of the round gets to launch the new dynamite
 
Or make your own rules!
